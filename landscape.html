                Our patent landscape reports powered by the in-house AI powered solution and including detailed
                infographics on technology trends will give you better insights on the technology domain and its
                evolution, assessment of strengths and weaknesses in your patent portfolio vis-a-vis your competitors,
                and an overview of the latest trends and specific developments in the industry.

                Our patent landscape analysis reports are customizable as per the client’s requirements and generally
                include:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Customized taxonomy</b>: For better insights, we do not rely on automatically classifying patents in
                your
                portfolio based on IPC classes. Rather, we understand that every client and project has different
                requirements. We specialize in creating a customized taxonomy to align with your technology/product
                line/competitor’s product strategy, depending on your objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Infographics</b>: Our reports include a variety of charts and illustrations for presenting the
                analysis in a
                lucid manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Market research</b>: A detailed research of the products landscape and commercial offerings by
                competitors
                in the technology domain to corroborate findings from the analysis of the patent landscape. </p>

            <p>
                State of the Art search helps in getting a comprehensive picture of a specific technology area. Our
                state of the art search report, based on detailed analysis of the patent landscape, helps clients make
                informed business decisions to better align their IP strategy with the overall growth strategy of the
                company. A State of the Art search also helps in identifying new competitors and technological trends.
                We provide customized reports based on the client requirement and use filters to narrow down our focus
                based on date range, assignees, keywords, etc. </p>
