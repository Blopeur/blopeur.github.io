                We conduct exhaustive searches to identify potential monetization opportunities for your IP assets. Our
                target scouting reports generally include an overview of the potentially infringing products, brief
                patent-product map summaries based on the infringement theory, an estimation of royalties/damages and
                relevant industry insights. Customizable based on your main requirements.
