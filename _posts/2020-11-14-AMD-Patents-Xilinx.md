Xilinx acquisition by AMD was a long time coming.
Not only it will allow AMD to make headway in the AI and datacenter market.
But more importantly, this will allow AMD to make headway at the edge which has the potential to be a much more lucrative market. By example, Xilinx released a few days ago Zynq RFSoC DFE. This adaptive radio platform is designed to meet the evolving standards of #5G NR wireless applications.

The astute observers could have had a hint of the Xilinx acquisition if they paid attention to the patents filed by AMD.
The following recent fillings are all heavily revolving around the integration of FPGA related technology:
