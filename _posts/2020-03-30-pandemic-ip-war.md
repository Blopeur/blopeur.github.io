It seems that countries and companies already start to position themselves to reap the benefits of the COVID-19 pandemic aftermath.
Recently, the [Korean IP Office (KIPO)](https://kipo.go.kr/kpo/MainApp) created [a specific website on patent information related to COVID-19](https://kipo.go.kr/ncov/index.html) called "Corona 19 patent information navigation". Among other contents, the new website includes the following features:

* Overview of important patents related to coronaviruses, such as SARS or MERS
* Detailed research reports and statistical analyses on technical trends with regard treatments, diagnostic, vaccinations, antiviral treatments etc.
* A platform for users to provide ideas from simple suggestions to inventions. Outstanding ideas might result in patent applications and honoured with government awards.

What is even more interesting is that the KIPO also provides expedited patent examination for inventions related to COVID-19 diagnostic kits, vaccination or medical treatment.
The patent office can grant patent within 10 days from filling!!! Moreover, the applicant may get further financial support for filing subsequent PCT applications for international coverage. 

With the US and EU patent office almost at a standstill, Korea is already positioning itself to take advantage of the upcoming pandemic related Intellectual Property windfall. I wouldn't be surprised if other governments follow suit soon.
