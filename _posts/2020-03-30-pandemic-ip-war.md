It seems that a lot of countries and companies are already positioning themselves to benefit from the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
By example, the [Korean IP Office (KIPO)](https://kipo.go.kr/kpo/MainApp) created [a specific website on patent information related to COVID-19](https://kipo.go.kr/ncov/index.html) called "Corona 19 patent information navigation". Among other contents, the new website includes the following features:
* Overview of important patents related to coronaviruses, such as SARS or MERS
* Detailed research reports and statistical analyses on technical trends with regard treatments, diagnostic, vaccinations, antiviral treatments etc.
* A platform for users to provide ideas from simple suggestions to inventions. Outstanding ideas might result in patent applications and honoured with government awards.

What is even more interesting is that the KIPO also provides expedited patent examination for inventions related to COVID-19 diagnostic kits, vaccination or medical treatment.
The patent office can grant patent within 10 days from filling!!! Not only that but the applicant may get further financial support for filing subsequent PCT applications for international coverage. 

We would not be surprised that other patent offices and governments start to coordinate in the same manners. However, Korea has a significant advantage here. As the country is not in complete lockdown and economic activity is still ongoing, albeit at a reduced pace. While Europe and the US are reaching a standstill, not mentioning the closure of the EPO and USPTO.
