Artificial intelligence (AI) remains one of the main features of most European countries’ strategies, even during these times of the COVID-19 emergency.
While there is little doubt about the benefits that that can be drawn from AI technology, there are also increasing concerns about how to effectively address the risks associated with the usage of AI systems. 

Such concerns include, among others, data privacy risks.
In essence, AI may easily be used to de-anonymize individuals’ data and also potential breaches of other fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, non-discrimination, human dignity,...
With this in mind, the European Commission recently published its [White Paper on Artificial Intelligence](https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/white-paper-artificial-intelligence-european-approach-excellence-and-trust_en).
This white paper describes the fundamental principles and guidelines for Trustworthy AI. 

In addition to some improvements to the liability regime, the EU Commission proposes to opt for a risk-based approach. The Commission aimed at making the regulatory intervention proportional to target mainly “high-risk” AI applications.
For instance, AI systems should operate with sufficiently broad data sets to cover all scenarios needed to avoid dangerous situations, thus avoiding unnecessary risks.
Accordingly, records should be kept on the data sets used to train and test the AI systems, as well as the main characteristics.
The Commission further highlighted that, to make future regulations effective, there should be a level playing field.
This requirement should be applied to all those that provide AI products or services in the EU, thus including non-EU companies.

The EU Commission didn't describe yet what mechanisms will be put in place for companies to satisfy those requirements.
But we can imagine that it might require them to register database and trade secret at teh EPO in order to satisfy their legal obligation.
