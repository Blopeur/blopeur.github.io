On May 11, 2021, the USPTO issued US Patent Number 11,000,000. Over the past 25 years, the number of U.S. patents has effectively doubled.

U.S. Patent No. 11,000,000 is one of a family of inventions owned by 4C Medical Tech. of Minneapolis directed to heart surgery tools. The inventors are Saravana Kumar and Jason Diedering.  The patent claims a method of delivering and also repositioning a prosthetic heart-valve (AltaValve) that is used to repair a leaky-valve issue experienced by several million Americans (typically over age 75).

The invention itself is quite simple â€” basically, there is a catheter tube with a set of wire pairs.  Each pair includes one wire with a looped end and a second with a straight end.  The pairs work together to deliver, release, and position the prosthetic valve within the heart.  The claims were rejected as obvious and then allowed after a fairly minor amendment.
