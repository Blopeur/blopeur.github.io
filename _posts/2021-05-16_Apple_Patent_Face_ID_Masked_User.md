The U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) has recently published a [continuation patent from Apple](https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220210133428%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20210133428&RS=DN/20210133428) showing possible improvements to Face ID biometrics in relation to users wearing masks.

The proposed solution leverage heat maps to assess the occlusion of key landmark on a user face (by wearing a mask).
The solution leverages the heatmap to estimate the location of landmarks on a user's face and may help the biometric algorithm to make a successful identification.
