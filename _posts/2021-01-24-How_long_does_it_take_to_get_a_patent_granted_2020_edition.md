The USPTO recently released its [FY2020 Performance and Accountability Report](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USPTOFY20PAR.pdf).
From this report we can extract some interesting information, and most importantly gage how long it tak for a patent to grant.
In 2020 the USPTO’s eight-year trend of reducing patent application pendency continued to trend downward.
The average time from filing to first action was 14.7 months.
The average total pendency — that is, the time from filing to either grant or abandonment — was 23.3 months.

The wait times varied based on the USPTO Technology Center that reviewed the application. 
The table and graph below provide a breakdown by technology.
