Looks like [Oxford Nanopore Technologies Inc. counsel may have used the current #COVID19](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-tactic-patent-jury-told-covid-19-is-47346/) situation to sway the jury in a #patent infringement case.
The counsel implied that if ONT is found liable it may somehow block efforts to remediate the current pandemic.

The case was filed years before this current #outbreak . 
Questions can be raised as to how important ONT technology or current effort by ONT is  related to the remediation of the #COVID19 outbreak effort
