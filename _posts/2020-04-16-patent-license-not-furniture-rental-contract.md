Sometimes it's not easy to decide which tribunal to bring an action when a party breach contract related to industrial property rights.
At least in France, it seems to be. 

However, a recent decision by the "court de cassation" made it clear that the business court, aka "Tribunal de commerce" is not the right venue to dispute a patent license matter. But the reason for the original change of venue to a commercial court request and the subsequent argument which led to this decision is quite interesting. 

Here is what happened: 

* A is a GIE (Economic Interest Group).
* A grants B the right to sell genetically modified animals using a patented technique.
* B agrees to pay A an advance on the fees paid by third-party buyers.
* A does not receive the expected royalties from B.
* A assigns for payment B before the "Tribunal de Grande Instance de Lyon".
* B opposes the incompetence of this court in favour of the "Business Court of Lyon".
* The Pre-Trial Judge of the Lyon Tribunal de Grande Instance dismissed this objection of incompetence.
* The Lyon Court of Appeal confirms the order.

Nothing unusual so far, except what B claimed for requesting the tribunal change.
B argued that the GIE carried on a rental business of **movable property**,
the patent license contracts being rental contracts of **intangible furniture**.

The French "court de cassation" rejected the request by declaring that :
_If the patent license is a rental contract whose object is an invention, the conclusion of this type of contract by a GIE owning a patent. That the GIE itself has filed does not constitute a furniture rental business within the meaning of article L. 110-1 4 Â° of the commercial code._

So here you go, licensing patent is not a furniture rental business.
