The [US Navy has patented antigravity](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Or as described by the inventors:  inertial mass reduction device.

The patent describes a device that uses a microwave emitter to create a high-frequency electromagnetic wave through a cavity to create a polarized vacuum.
This polarized vacuum, in turn, reduces the mass of the vehicle containing the device.

It seems that the inventors propose to use the properties of high energy electromagnetic field generator to interact strongly with the vacuum energy state.
The system described seems, according to the authors, to generate quantum fields' fluctuations permeating the entire fabric of spacetime.
Which in this case, the aim is to alter the material to create an antigravity field...
