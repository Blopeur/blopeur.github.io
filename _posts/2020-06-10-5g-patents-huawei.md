Intellectual property battle for #5G dominance is raging.
While a lot of company focus on the numbers game, a recent study cast a different light on qualitative vs quantitative patent landscape.

It has been long known that Asian company are at the top of the leaderboards for the total number of 5G patents owned.
However, a recent study by Amplified & Grey show that they are not only leading on the quantitative front but also qualitative.
According to Amplified & Grey, #Huawei alone holds almost as many actually-essential 5G patents as #Nokia and #Ericsson combined.
Moreover, Samsung, Huawei, and LG seem to own almost half (48%) of the essential 5G patent.

For a long time, the narrative has been that Asian players owed their lead to a high rate of over declarations.
This seems to no longer be true and this will have a long-lasting impact on the future of telco landscape.
