            <h3 class="lead" id="anchor1"> Invalidity and Validity Search</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                A prior art search can be helpful in multiple scenarios depending on the immediate requirements. For
                example, a prior art search may be performed to invalidate the claims of a patent as a defensive
                strategy in a lawsuit or validate the enforceability of a patent.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Patent Validity Search or Patent Invalidity Search is an exhaustive prior art search conducted after
                patent issuance. These two searches are identical except for the desired outcome (valid or invalid
                patent claims) of the search.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Patent Validity Search will determine whether a patent can withstand attack in litigation. Our team
                provides clients with an in-depth analysis of the patent art that may be used to validate the
                enforceability of a patent. Clients only need to provide the patent number and the claims of interest
                and we will conduct an extensive search of US and foreign patents, publications and technical
                literature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, a validity search can provide a good idea of how useful the patent will be in licensing
                negotiations. A prospective licensee may want to conduct a validity search to determine the strength of
                the patent. The licensee can then adjust their minimum royalty payments according to the findings before
                entering into licensing negotiations.
            </p>
            <p>
                When confronted by allegations of patent infringement, proof of invalidity based on prior art is the
                first line of defence. The patent invalidity search is generally wide-ranging and extensive because an
                entire patent infringement lawsuit may depend on it. Thus, a patent invalidity search is an all-out
                attack on the patent.
            </p>
            <p>
                A client may use the results of a patent invalidity search to try to invalidate the patent either by
                litigation or by filing a petition to institute an inter partes review of the patent at the U.S. Patent
                and Trademark Office.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our specialized tools, including the in-house AI based search system, help us provide
                actionable results with quick turnaround times and reduced costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, experience and positive client feedback has reaffirmed our belief in the value of
                conducting searches based on the context of the patent and the case. A higher number of results do not
                add value if they are not related to the technology in question.
            </p>
            <h3 class="lead" id="anchor2"> Contingency Based Search</h3>
            <p>
                Similar to a patent litigation, the outcome of a prior art search is not predictable. Sometimes, it
                makes more sense to do a contingency-based search to ensure that you pay only if you get the right
                results. Our technology expertise and creative approach gives us the confidence to provide
                contingency-based services, thus providing a guaranteed value-add.
            </p>
            <h3 class="lead" id="anchor3"> Knockout Search</h3>
            <p>
                Our knockout search is not limited by the number of hours spent on the project. Our focus is on
                exhausting all possible avenues to ensure that if there’s a prior art hidden somewhere, we can unearth
                it to make your case stronger. This single-minded focus on results and our extensive search experience
                allows us to deliver quality knockout search reports with a high success rate.
            </p>
            <h3 class="lead" id="anchor4"> Patentability Search</h3>
            <p>
                A patentability search, sometimes called a patent novelty search or simply a novelty search, is
                conducted to ascertain whether a potential invention is novel, or not, by determining whether anyone
                else publicly disclosed the inventive concept prior to its critical date. It also helps in deciding
                whether the invention meets the requirements of novelty and non-obviousness. Blopeur’s patentability
                searches allow patent practitioners, corporations, and individual inventors to make the application
                process easier by anticipating what the examiner will cite during prosecution of a patent application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further, our analysis of the search results strengthens the patent application and claims by
                anticipating potential invalidity concerns during re-examination and/or litigation. Most importantly, a
                determination is made on whether the invention is worth pursuing for patent protection given the state
                of the published art.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our patentability patent searches cover US, WIPO, EPO. We also thoroughly search Non-Patent Literature, including related
                electronically available journals, websites, technical literature, manuals, books, articles, and blogs.
            </p>
            <h3 class="lead" id="anchor5"> FTO Search</h3>
            <p>
                Before the launch of a new product or the launch of an existing product in a new geography, it is
                crucial to conduct a freedom-to-operate (FTO) or a clearance search. It is also prudent to conduct an
                FTO search prior to a business acquisition or prior to entering into a new technology area.
            </p>
            <p>
                FTO searches identify potential patent barriers to the commercialization of products or technologies.
                We will identify published applications and unexpired patents that may be closely
                related to the technology in question. This helps us identify potential barriers to a product launch and
                brainstorm ways to circumvent those barriers. Our search will also help our clients determine if the
                product or service they are pursuing is in the public domain. We can focus solely on US patents and
                published documents or we can broaden our scope to include foreign patent documents depending on the
                client requirement.
            </p>
            <p>
                While conducting an FTO search, we do not restrict our search to cases of literal infringement but also
                consider infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, indirect infringement, and the
                extra-territorial reach of U.S. patent laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                All searches undergo iCuerious’ thorough quality assurance checks before they are delivered to our
                clients.
            </p>
            <h3 class="lead" id="anchor6"> Design Search</h3>
            <p>
                A search prior to registration of a design is vital to ensure the uniqueness of your design and to
                confirm that similar designs have not been registered already. Wprior.htmle have conducted several
                design based searches in domains ranging from ornamental product designs to medical devices and
                electronics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our extensive experience in delivering quality design searches and strong analytical skills help us
                understand the uniqueness and precise elements of each design. Additionally, we follow a standard
                operating procedure which can be easily customized to meet specific client requirements.
