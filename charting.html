                Our detailed reports with interactive infringement charts and patent-product/patent-standard maps
                combined with a creative approach to unearth hidden evidence will give you a clear picture of whether
                the patent is worth pursuing for a deep dive analysis for litigation/licensing.

                A typical evidence of use report prepared by Blopeur Ltd. includes an overview, including an executive
                summary, of the subject patent and the invention, commercial significance of the technology in question
                based on comprehensive market research, potential infringing products and their estimated revenue, and a
                preliminary mapping of the product/standard on the patent claims. This is accompanied by a
                recommendation of the most promising products which can be explored further for a detailed infringement
                analysis or a deep-dive report. </p>

                Whether you are involved in Patent Licensing, Patent Litigation, or are looking to acquire or sell
                patents, a key factor in the decision making process is to know which companies may have products
                infringing your patented technology or which patents should you acquire to get extra protection for your
                marquee products. We offers Patent-Product Maps as a tool to help make these decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Patent-Product Map cross-references patents to companies and related products that are likely to use
                the invention. By combining this information with market revenue and market share information, informed
                decisions on licensing targets, patent divestiture or acquisition, etc. can be made. </p>
