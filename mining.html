                Identification and ranking of the most valuable patents in the portfolio based on significance of the
                underlying technology and market potential.
                Determination of the cumulative worth of a portfolio based on opportunities for monetization via
                licensing/litigation routes.

            <h3 class="lead" id="anchor2"> Portfolio Screening</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We screen your patent portfolio against target
                products from companies across all domains. In the past, we have worked on portfolio screening projects
                related to domains such as Big Data, IA, Cloud, Database, Virtualization, computer networking as well as
                emerging technologies including virtual and augmented reality, Internet-of-Things (IoT) etc.

                Our targeted focus on the project requirements has enabled clients to make strategic decisions on
                litigation and/or licensing, helping them secure favorable verdicts in high-stakes patent litigations or
                striking lucrative licensing deals.

            <h3 class="lead" id="anchor3"> Patent Ranking and Portfolio Evaluation</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We focus on qualitative and quantitative parameters to identify the most valuable patents, assess
                monetization opportunities and make informed decisions about the monetization potential, and support
                licensing programs to achieve optimal client rewards.
            </p>
            <p>
                A set of potential high-value patents is extracted using our proprietary patent-ranking algorithm.
                Detailed analysis of the shortlisted patents is then conducted by our technology specialists to identify
                the most valuable (diamond) patents. A plethora of parameters is used in this analysis, including market
                applicability, infringement detectability, enforceability and validity. Every patent is ranked on a
                rating scale (with specific criteria based on the requirements of the project) and a rationale behind
                the assignment of a particular rating is provided for clarity and ease of understanding. A final
                recommendation is then provided along with a cumulative score for effective sorting of the patents.

                To summarize, you’ll get a clear and concise analysis highlighting the strengths and market potential of
                the patent portfolio, and customized reports as per your specific requirements and objectives.

            <h3 class="lead" id="anchor4"> Patent Portfolio Management</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                In today’s competitive landscape, building strong IP assets is essential to stay ahead of your
                competitors and is integral to the overall growth strategy of the company. Aligning the patent portfolio
                with a company’s business objectives helps in maximizing the value of the innovations and in generating
                returns on the R&D investment. A process of continual filing without active portfolio management can
                result in your patent budget spiralling out of control. This is where active management and monitoring
                of your patent portfolio becomes necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                You’ll get a clear and concise analysis highlighting the strengths and the market potential of your
                portfolio, and customized reports as per your specific requirements and objectives.

                Recommendation of patents for divestment to closely align the portfolio with the product offerings and
                business strategy, and reduce maintenance costs.
                Effective monitoring of the portfolio to identify opportunities for executing effective licensing
                programs .

            <h3 class="lead" id="anchor5"> IP Due Diligence</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We help in accurately determining the true worth of a patent portfolio by providing actionable insights
                and recommendations on the commercial potential after conducting thorough due diligence. We specialize
                in both buy-side and sell-side due diligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> Buy-side Due Diligence</b>
                If you are looking at acquiring a patent portfolio, we’ll estimate the value of the patents based on
                technology assessment and its commercial use. We’ll also provide an in-depth evaluation of the strength
                of the portfolio and analyse how acquiring the portfolio may strengthen your R&D strategy based on close
                alignment of the combined portfolio with your product pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Sell-side Due Diligence</b>
                If you’re interested in maximizing the return on your IP or if you are looking to reduce maintenance
                costs while maintaining the core strengths of your portfolio, we will help you conduct a thorough due
                diligence of your current portfolio and provide recommendations on out-licensing/patent assertion and
                divestment strategy through customized reports.
